All Teaching Assistants (TAs) for 5.111 must go through a 5-day training prior to the start of the course.

Teaching Assistant (TA) Information and Expectations for 5.111
--------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the course, we will introduce connections between disciplines and demonstrate the relevance of chemical principles by incorporating examples from biology and medicine. These connections will be made through in-class examples and reinforced through biology-related problem-set questions. We hope to facilitate the class's understanding of and enthusiasm for chemistry through these connections as well as by communicating our own excitement for the material through our teaching. You as TAs have a major impact on the success of these goals through your interactions with students in your recitation sections and office hours.

Below we provide some general expectations for Teaching Assistants. TAing this course involves

*   **Attending all class lectures**, which are 3 times per week.
*   **Preparing for and leading your recitation section**, which will meet twice per week. You will be provided with suggested problems and topics for each recitation, but you are free to structure your classroom in whatever way works best for your class. During this training we will discuss active learning strategies, setting expectations, and other related topics.
*   **Participating in weekly TA meetings**.
*   **Holding two office hours per week** (as one 2-hour or two 1-hour sessions). In addition, many students send questions by email, so please check your email at least once each morning and afternoon.
*   **Grading problem sets and exams**. Problem sets are due each week. Homework should be graded and returned in recitation sections. Exams will be graded immediately following each exam.
*   **Reinforcing the biology-connections made in the lecture and in the problem sets**.

Introduction of the 5.111 faculty.

Discussion on goals of the course, goals of TA training, and resources for TAs and students.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen rowspan="4" >}}
Practice exams and biology-related problems were sent to each TA over the summer. These were provided to familiarize you with the problem types in 5.111 and to help you identify concepts that you may need to spend extra time on during training or during the course. Please attempt all problems prior to training, and come prepared with questions.
